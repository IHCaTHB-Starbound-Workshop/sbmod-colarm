Does not add any new colors, just new combinations of existing colors.
This can be used as a tool for easily adding new color options to generated weapons, a sample patch and guide will be published to the forums.
This version also comes loaded with unique files for the various weapon tiers so that you can add certain colors to only appear on weapons of certain rarities.
